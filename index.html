          <p>
            When two entities meet at a point, they cause a blur. This interesting process is known as <span class="gradient">convergence</span>. Here, we are entitled to discover the endless cosmos—which is a representation of <span class="gradient">two elements</span>.

            <br>
            <br>

            Stars, stellar galaxies, and the continuous realm of celestial bodies, is broadly formed under the two elements. What are these two elements? What are they further composed of?

          <p>
            The first element is <span class="gradient">art</span>—the designer of all matter. They add color to life, which is animate, and make dim light bright, which is essential. The second element is <span class="gradient">science</span>—the decider of all fate. Science decides what happens in this mysterious cosmos.

          <p>What you have yet read has not allowed you to fully explore the cosmos, yet. It must be noted that art and science are divided into a large set of its constituents. Art is made up of colors, shape, size, and design. Science is made up of physics and atoms. However, there is one thing in common. Both work hand-in-hand with each other. <b>This is convergence.</b></p>

          <p>You have finished reading this page. However, you conclude that the continual advancement of humanity in the field of art and science will never remain unnoticed. You interpret that when art and science blend, you create something unique. In the long run, this continuity is what will count.</p>
